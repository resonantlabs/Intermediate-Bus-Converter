With PCBs requiring higher power, higher input voltage and various different output rails, the complexity and issues with multiple dc/dc converters can cause a lot of headaches. Things like EMI, stability and costs are all important factors to consider.

An example is a device that accepts 48Vin +/- 2.5V and has output rails of 12V/5A, 5V/5A, 3.3V/10A
