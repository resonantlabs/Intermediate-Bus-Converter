# Open Sourcing Intermediate Bus Converters for High Power Electronics

This is an Open Source Project to create a framework for seemlessly incorporating Intermediate Bus Converters (IBC) into your PCB design. 

## What are Intermediate Bus Converters (IBC)



Most engineers who design electronics are quite comfortable using buck and boost converters for their designs. The ICs are typically easy to use and the manufactures provide lots of help to the get your project off the ground. 

An example is a device that accepts 48Vin +/- 2.5V and has output rails of 12V/5A, 5V/5A, 3.3V/10A
